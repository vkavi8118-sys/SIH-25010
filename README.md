## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
We propose developing a smart, multilingual, AI-powered advisory platform accessible via mobile app and chatbot.

How it Addresses the Problem

Provides farmers with personalized, location-specific recommendations on crops, fertilizers, and pest control.

Enables real-time decision-making using soil, weather, and market data.

Reduces reliance on guesswork and middlemen for critical farming decisions.

Ensures accessibility through voice support and regional language interfaces.

Innovation and Uniqueness

Combines AI + multilingual voice + image-based detection in a single platform.

Built for low-literate users with simplified UI and audio prompts.

Integrates market intelligence along with agronomy insights.

Provides feedback-driven learning, improving recommendations over time.

## Technical Approach
Technologies to be Used

Mobile App/Chatbot: Flutter, React Native, or WhatsApp-based bot.

AI & ML Models: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch for pest/disease detection.

Backend: Node.js/Django with cloud hosting (AWS/Azure).

Database: PostgreSQL + GIS for location mapping.

APIs: Weather data APIs, market price feeds, soil health datasets.

Voice & Language Support: Google Speech-to-Text, OpenAI Whisper, or Indic NLP libraries.

Methodology / Implementation Process

Collect soil, weather, and crop data (regional datasets).

Build an advisory engine combining AI models and expert rules.

Develop multilingual UI/voice support for mobile and chatbot.

Integrate pest detection via farmer image uploads.

Provide predictive weather and price alerts.

Pilot test with selected farmer groups in Punjab.

Scale based on feedback and usage analytics.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: High – due to availability of mobile connectivity and existing AI frameworks.

Challenges:

Low digital literacy among farmers.

Ensuring localized, accurate advisory.

Building trust in technology over traditional practices.

Strategies to Overcome Challenges:

Voice-based interaction and regional language support.

Collaboration with local extension officers and NGOs for adoption.

Pilot programs to build credibility through demonstrated results.

## Impact and Benefits
Potential Impact on Target Audience

Farmers gain accurate, personalized, and timely advice, leading to improved crop yield and profitability.

Benefits of the Solution

Social: Empowers small farmers, reduces exploitation by intermediaries.

Economic: Higher yield, lower input costs, better price realization.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable practices and reduces chemical overuse.
